# Pseudo-Analog-Video-Transmission
This code can simulate video transmission using a pseudo-analog communication method.

# Usage
Execute the following command

python main.py

#Note
The image used should have a resolution in multiples of 8 for both rows and columns.

channel.py adapts changes in the wireless environment to signal changes. In practice, it adds path loss, shadowing, multipath fading, and signal changes due to noise.
